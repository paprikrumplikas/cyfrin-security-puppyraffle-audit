Possivle attack vectors:

1. contract is ownable, but...
2. Documentation says you can enter yourself multiple times. This is not correct.
3. gas optimization: dont use players.length in the loop. Use a local var isntead
4. refund() should read the address of the msg.sender, not some silly index
5. duplicate check cannot do anythign with address(0)
6. winner can be null address
7. totalAmountCollected is not correct, does not take zero addresses into account
